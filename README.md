Predicting Female Life Expectancy Using SDG Indicators
This project leverages Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators as features to predict female life expectancy across countries with varying income levels. Using Python and PySpark, the project performs:
(1) Data Collection and Processing: Prepares and organizes datasets for analysis.
(2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes distribution histograms, correlation plots, and feature analysis.
(3) Machine Learning Model Development: Implements Random Forest Regression models to evaluate life expectancy predictions.
(4) Model Parameter Analysis: Analyzes feature importance and evaluates model performance using RMSE and ùëÖ2 statistics.
The findings aim to provide actionable insights into the impact of SDG indicators on female life expectancy and support public health and policymaking efforts.
