# Predicting Female Life Expectancy Using SDG Indicators<br>
This project leverages Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators as features to predict female life expectancy across countries with varying income levels.  
## Using Python and PySpark, the project performs:
(1) Data Collection and Processing: Prepares and organizes datasets for analysis.
<br>(2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes distribution histograms, correlation plots, and feature analysis.
<br>(3) Machine Learning Model Development: Implements Random Forest Regression models to evaluate life expectancy predictions.
<br>(4) Model Parameter Analysis: Analyzes feature importance and evaluates model performance using RMSE and ùëÖ2 statistics.  
<br>The findings aim to provide actionable insights into the impact of SDG indicators on female life expectancy and support public health and policymaking efforts.The datasets is documentes under [data.csv](https://github.com/Alyssaqin/SDG-Female-s-Life-Expectancy/blob/main/dataset.csv).
